The solutions needed to solve the 21st century global challanges that humanity faces are largerly similar. Beyond the confines of the physical, geographical and what have you boundaries, what a human being living in 2025 needs is **sound knowledge** and **empowerment** to tackle questions that rise through their lifetime with more **fortitude, conviction and absolute surety**.

These questions come from vitally integrated topics like: 
* **Environmental sustainability**
* **Healthy living and longevity**
* **Joy and happiness**
* **Job security**
* **Stable relationships**
* **Good education**
* **Matters of Faith!**

The list is long.

But does that mean that all hope lost? 

Absolutely not!

The good news is that some of the answers we need as humanity are just a click and scroll away!

Isn't that reassuring?

## I'll tell you what qualifies my absolute optimism about the feasibility of empowering humanity through sound knowledge in some of the mentioned topics 
As a gifted creative, academic and Christian, I hope to:
* First, create and consolidate knowledge through  research and sharing personal and, other people's experiences
* Secondly, Writing a creative code to disseminate the knowledge.
* Finally, making the conglomerated, compounded and hopefully perfect outcome readily available through a website with a plethora of webpages. Ultimately, provide answers to some of the aforementioned areas of profound importance with just a click and scrol!

* ## Precisely,

* The topics that I would like to publish about on my websites include, but are not limited to,
 1. The Christian Faith
 2. Environmental sustainability
 3. General chemistry across all levels.

**Currently learning Cloud Website Developement through the United Kingdom Department for Education funded boot camp in partnership with Hyperion Development, I envision graduating with robust skills that are imperative to build numerous websites.**

* Progressively, I am happy to collaborate with project partners who share a similar *vision and  mantra* to **CREATE Knowledge, Creatively CODE and COMMUNICATE it**
